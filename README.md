# LDA workshop

These materials are available as a resource for a workshop presented by [Fast
Forward Labs](http://www.fastforwardlabs.com/).

If you are attending the workshop and would like to run the code on your own
machine as we go through (which is not necessary, but will increase your
understanding), then there are some things you should do before the workshop.

 1. Download this repository. To do this use `git clone` if you have git on
    your machine, or click the green "Clone and Download" button, then
    "Download ZIP".

 2. Ensure you have the requirements installed. You'll need:
  
     - Python 2.7 or higher
     - jupyter notebook, numpy and pandas
     - scikit-learn 0.18.2 or higher (the LDA algorithm was added in 0.18.1 but
       had a bug that was fixed in 0.18.2)
     - Optionally, if you would like to build an interactive visualization of a
       topic model then you'll need pyLDAvis 1.5 or higher, but this is not
       absolutely necessary to run the core of the notebook.

    These dependencies can be installed using `conda` (if you have Anaconda
    Python) or `pip install` (if you are using standard tools, in which case do
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`).

Alternatively, if you just want to follow along with the presentation without
running the code locally, view [lda_rendered.ipynb on Github by clicking this
link](lda_rendered.ipynb) in your browser.
